Design for the VM

opcodes:

expect_token(token_id)
call_rull(rule_id)
start_optional(forward_dest)
end_optional(code_frag_id)
start_loop0(forward_dest)
end_loop0(code_frag_id)
start_loop1(forward_dest)
end_loop1(code_frag_id)
start_alt(dest)
end_alt()

state in stack frame:

link to previous stack frame
link to opcode array
program counter (index into opcode array)
stack of values returned by rules and tokens
stack of end destinations and their types
  i.e. active optionals and loops
stack of marks (indexes into token array)

dynamic global state:

array of input tokens (lazily grows as needed)
input position (index into array of input tokens)
token cache
  indexed by (input position, token_id)
  gives either None or (token, new input position)
symbol cache
  indexed by (input position, rule_id)
  gives either None or (tree, new input position)

static global state:

opcode arrays for all rule_ids
table of code fragments to be used for building the tree

how does the engine work:

tokenizer is a black box
all global state is input
rule_id for start symbol is given
create first stack frame (all stacks empty)
use opcode array from start rule_id
put pc at 0
loop:
  decode next opcode, move pc
  execute opcode
  if it's an uncached call, create a new stack frame
when falling of the end or upon completion of a top-level alternative:
  should have one node in hand
  if there's a back link, resume previous frame, back to (loop:) above
  else that's the tree for the entire parse
when failing and there's no back link:
  report a syntax error at the furthest point the tokenizer made it

Dynamic state should not be used to keep track of static properties of
the program (e.g. what to do if a rule call fails).  It should be used
only for:

- return address from a rule call
- values collected so far ($1, $2, ...)
- return value of last call ($$)

The rest can be expressed in the opcodes directly, e.g.

expr: term '+' term { $$ = $1 + $3 } | term '-' term { $$ = $1 - $3 } | term { $$ = $1 }

Let's say opcodes have two extra fields, next=N, fail=N, giving labels
of where to go on success or failure.  Also another extra field where
to store the value on success.

# Rule expr

# term '+' term { $$ = $1 + $3 }
L0:  call term; store=$1; next=L1; fail=L5
L1:  expect '+'; store=$2; next=L2; fail=L5  # No store!
L2:  call term; store=$3; next=L3; fail=L5
L3:  exec "$$ = $1 + $3"; next=L4
L4:  return $$

# term '-' term { $$ = $1 - $3 }
L5:  call term; store=$1; next=L6; fail=L10
L6:  expect '-'; store=$2; next=L7; fail=L10
L7:  call term; store=$3; next=L8; fail=L10
L8:  exec "$$ = $1 - $3"; next=L9
L9:  return $$

# term { $$ = $1 }
L10: call term; store=$1; next=L11; fail=L13
L11: exec "$$ = $1"; next=L12
L12: return $$

13: fail

Hm, okay, so next is always the next instruction, so we don't need
that, unless the instructions are stored in a dict.

Variables per stack frame:
$$ (return from exec block)
$1, $2, $3, ... (results from call and expect)

Then we need a stack of frames, so each rule in progress has its own
variables.  In addition to the above $ variables, the stack frame
needs a program counter so when a frame is popped we know where to
continue.

Upon return from a (rule) call we take the return value (always $$?)
from the called frame and store it in the calling frame at the spot
indicated by store=$VAR, then move to the next instruction.  We
indicate failure by returning NULL (an old tradition).

So how do we generate code for an optional field?

term: ['-'] NAME { $$ = -$2 if $1 else $2 }

L1: expect '-'; store=$1; next=L2; fail=L2
L2: expect NAME; store=$1; next=L3
L3: exec "$$ = -$2 if $1 else $2"; next=L4
L4: return $$

What about a longer optional field?

factor: atom ['*' atom] { $$ = $1 * $3 if $2 else $1 }

L1: call atom; store=$1; next=L2; fail=L6
L2: expect '*'; store=$2; next=L3; fail=L4
L3: call atom; store=$3; next=L4; fail=L7
L4: exec "$$ = $1 * $3 if $2 else $1"; next=L5
L5: return $$
L6: fail
L7: clear $2; next=L4

Here the weird new thing is the clear instruction, needed to erase the
traces of the '*' already stored in $2 when we don't find an atom
following the '+'.

??? A different approach here would be to store the result of ['+'
atom] in a combining node (like a tuple).  But then the executable
code needs to be aware of that. ???

What about an optional field containing alternatives?

factor: atom ['*' atom | '/' atom] { $$ = $1 * $3 if $2 else $1 * $5 if $4 else $1 }
